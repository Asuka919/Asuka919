# Spot Widget Manager

👋 Hi, I’m @Asuka919

👀 I’m interested in creating tools/websites/anything to do with coding or computer science. Just anything to help simplify things for others!

🌱 I’m currently learning more about music APIs and widget development. I'm not exactly a beginner in coding, but this is my 2nd Major Project! 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that integrate music features and improve user interaction.

⚡ Fun fact: I've been coding for almost 2 years, still discovering what's going on, and how to manage everything. I'm still learning, but as time goes, I get better and better! I also am into game development, which hopefully soon, I will get back into doing that! I'm 17 years of age, 18 in 3 more days (August 7th 2006)!!!
